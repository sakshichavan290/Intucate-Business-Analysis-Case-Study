# Intucate User Engagement & Strategic Analysis ðŸ“Š

### **Project Goal: Translating Raw User Activity into Actionable Product Strategy**

This project documents a comprehensive **Business Analyst** case study for the Intucate platform. It demonstrates the ability to manage fragmented data, conduct feature performance analysis, identify root causes for product challenges, and formulate a data-backed strategic marketing campaign for the **Diagnostic Test** module.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:** Data Sourcing & Validation, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Requirements Elicitation, Stakeholder Reporting, Strategic Campaign Optimization.

***

## **Phase 1: Problem Definition & Root Cause Analysis** (Task 1)

The initial assessment defined the problem space for the Diagnostic Test feature, documenting both technical and user experience challenges.

* **Identified Risks (Technical & Usability):** The feature was disrupted by technical risks (backend sync, unstable API, data privacy) and usability concerns (test length, visuals, difficulty).
* **BA Recommendation:** Prioritize fixing technical glitches and implementing short, student-friendly tests (less than 10 questions) to improve satisfaction and sustained engagement.

***

## **Phase 2: Data Sourcing & Validation** (Task 2)

The raw data was sourced from spreadsheet screenshots. The primary BA challenge was to validate and normalize this non-standard input to ensure data integrity.

| Data Validation Step | Result | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Sourcing** | Manually synthesized and entered data from **multiple image files** into a single digital workbook. | Demonstrated adaptability in managing fragmented source data. |
| **Cleaning & Normalization** | Corrected all mismatched date formats and standardized feature name typos (e.g., `DiagnostiC T3st` to 'Diagnostic Test'). | Ensured the dataset was reliable for strategic analysis. |
| **Insight Generation** | Created Pivot Tables and Charts to analyze **Usage by Feature** and **Usage by Day of the Week**. | Identified **Flashcards** as the most-used feature (e.g., Usage Count: 27), indicating strong user demand for quick recall tools. |

***

## **Phase 3: Stakeholder Reporting & Strategic Planning** (Tasks 3 & 4)

Data insights were used to develop high-level deliverables for both internal stakeholders (pitch deck) and external campaigns (marketing assets).

### **A. Stakeholder Communication (Pitch Deck)**

* **Communication Title:** "The Learning Revolution: How Our Data-Driven Approach is Reshaping Education ðŸš€".
* **Core Takeaway:** "Flashcards are our most used feature, indicating that students prefer quick, accessible tools for review and retention."
* **Benefits Framed:** Defined three strategic benefits: **Targeted Learning** (via Diagnostic Test), **Effective Retention** (via Flashcards), and **Structured Success**, all explicitly tied to platform features.

### **B. Digital Campaign Strategy**

| Element | Strategic Recommendation | Justification (Data-Driven Optimization) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Platform Choice** | **Meta Ads (Instagram/Facebook)** | Optimal for running a visual, static creative and reaching the young CA Foundation student demographic. |
| **Creative Message** | **"Stop Guessing, Start Knowing."** | Positions the Diagnostic Test as the necessary starting point for efficient study. |
| **Campaign Optimization** | **Adopt the Audience Targeting from the Winning May Campaign.** | The May campaign demonstrated a superior **CTR (2.1% vs 1.2%)** and **Conversion Rate (15 vs 8)**, proving it was the most effective audience segment to target for future campaigns. |
